# IIT-Reimagination-Challenge-Hackathon
Hackathon Date: March 29th - March 30th 2014. IIT (Illinois Institute of Technology) threw a hackathon asking their students to create software that could improve the school. I was then not a student of IIT nor am I now. Me and IIT students created an information app with Test to Speech capabilty that answered and informed people on the school.

This project was made in Visual Studios 2010. Opening in that version of visual studios will gurantee it working. 

Hackathon Date: March 29th - March 30th 2014. IIT (Illinois Institute of Technology) threw a hackathon asking their students to create
software that could improve the school. I was then not a student of IIT nor am I now. The hackathon was only for IIT students but they
told me I was deeply welcome to compete if I wanted to as I had gone to many of their hackathons at their point. Me and IIT students 
created an information app with Test to Speech capabilty that answered and informed people on the school.
